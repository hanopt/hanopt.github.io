    <h2 id="what-will-you-need-for-your-trip">What will you need for your trip?</h2>

<p>Follow a simple rule: <strong>pack as little as possible</strong>.<br />
I‚Äôve met cyclists who managed their tours with just two panniers ‚Äî and that was enough. Especially in summer, you don‚Äôt need much gear.</p>

<p>Of course, you can buy lots of equipment for your trip, but many items will turn out to be useless, only making your luggage heavier and bulkier. Focus on the essentials.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the best bikepacking experiences happen when you travel with someone else. Sharing the struggles and the good moments makes the journey more fun.<br />
Take a small Bluetooth speaker with you ‚Äî cycling to music together can be a great mood boost.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-is-the-best-time-for-a-tour">What is the best time for a tour?</h2>

<p>I recommend starting your first trips in <strong>summer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It‚Äôs warm, which makes long days outside much easier.</li>
  <li>Nights are mild, so you won‚Äôt freeze.</li>
  <li>If it rains, you can dry your equipment quickly once the sun comes back.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="where-to-go">Where to go?</h2>

<p>Choose a route with <strong>paved bike paths</strong> and as little car traffic as possible.</p>

<p>I personally enjoyed cycling along the <strong>Rhine river</strong> ‚Äî it has great cycling infrastructure. <strong>Sweden</strong> was also fantastic, though sometimes you‚Äôll end up on car roads. The good news: many of them are quiet with little traffic.</p>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt blindly trust Google Maps. Sometimes it will lead you onto terrible gravel roads, costing you hours. Always check elevation gain as well.</p>

<p>That said, don‚Äôt avoid challenging routes entirely ‚Äî some of the most beautiful places are hidden along the harder paths.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>
<p>Proper sleep is essential on a bike tour. Make sure you don‚Äôt freeze at night.</p>

<p>In summer, a <strong>thin sleeping bag</strong> is usually enough ‚Äî sometimes it‚Äôs so warm you barely need it, but temperatures can drop quickly at night. It‚Äôs better to be prepared than to wake up shivering and searching for extra clothes in the dark.</p>

<p>Look for quiet camping spots: flat ground in forests, near lakes, or wild camping areas (like in Sweden, where it‚Äôs allowed). Be careful with campfires ‚Äî in dry seasons they can be forbidden due to wildfire risk.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Tent</li>
  <li>Inflatable sleeping mat</li>
  <li>Sleeping bag (even in summer)</li>
  <li>Earplugs &amp; eye mask (great for naps during the day)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="food">Food</h3>
<p>In countries with higher prices, it can be worth bringing something small but valuable, like <strong>a bottle of good olive oil</strong>.</p>

<p>The cheapest option is always buying food in supermarkets and cooking yourself. Don‚Äôt buy too much at once ‚Äî it just adds weight. Shop more frequently when you actually need to.</p>

<p>Refilling water is one of the most important things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ask people directly ‚Äî many will happily help.</li>
  <li>Cemeteries often have water taps available.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Checklist:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Small gas cooker</li>
  <li>Cooking pot &amp; bowl</li>
  <li>Water bottles</li>
  <li>Knife &amp; spoon</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="keep-your-stuff-organized">Keep your stuff organized</h3>
<p>Invest in panniers, frame bags, or drybags that attach securely to your bike.</p>

<p>Use <strong>organizer bags</strong> to separate categories like hygiene, clothing, and rain gear. It will save you endless time searching for things.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Frame bag &amp; 2 panniers</li>
  <li>Organizer pouches for small items</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="stay-clean--protect-your-body">Stay clean &amp; protect your body</h3>
<p>Weather changes quickly: it can be hot, rainy, or windy in a single day.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wear too much ‚Üí you sweat heavily.</li>
  <li>Wear too little ‚Üí you risk freezing.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cycle along rivers or lakes, take a quick swim to wash yourself and your clothes. Hang wet clothes over panniers or handlebars to dry while riding ‚Äî even tents can dry this way. Avoid packing wet gear inside bags.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Spare underwear, socks, T-shirts, long sleeve, shorts</li>
  <li>Cap, sunscreen, sunglasses</li>
  <li>Sandals (often enough in summer)</li>
  <li>Rain jacket &amp; pants</li>
  <li>Mosquito head net</li>
  <li>Small first aid kit</li>
  <li>Toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, soap</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
<p>A <strong>phone</strong> is usually enough for navigation.</p>

<p>If you want to challenge yourself (and save battery), bring a <strong>paper map</strong>. If you struggle to navigate, just ask some locals. It‚Äôs also a great way to start a conversation and learn a bit more about the local culture.</p>

<p>There are gadgets like Garmin devices and GPS watches, but for most beginners, a phone + power bank works perfectly.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Phone holder for handlebar</li>
  <li>Power bank &amp; charging cables</li>
</ul>
