title: "My Book Writing Journey"
---

My book-writing journey started in December. The idea came to me after a particularly busy weekend where I gave four mushroom tours back-to-back. I had spent around 16 hours in the forest, guiding beginners through the fascinating world of mushrooms. By the end, I felt completely exhausted—not just from the walking, but from answering the same questions again and again.  

That’s when I decided to start writing those questions down, along with detailed answers. They eventually became the foundation for my chapter *“Einsteigerfragen”* (Beginner Questions).  

Another major reason for starting the book was the huge collection of mushroom photos I had gathered over the years. I already had a small mushroom booklet drafted in Canva, so at first, I thought I could simply expand it into a full book. But after a few weeks, I realized Canva was the wrong tool for such a big project. Citations were hard to handle, and I wanted my book to have a scientific touch. On top of that, I hit Canva’s storage limit, which meant I would have had to pay for their premium plan just to continue working—a pretty sneaky way of luring people into subscriptions.  

So, I made the tough decision to switch completely to **LaTeX** and set up **TeXStudio**. Transferring everything over was tedious, but absolutely worth it. LaTeX can be frustrating at times, but once it’s running, it’s powerful. Citations, image placement, cross-references, and page numbers all update automatically. I even managed to create two glossaries: one for key terms and another for all the mushroom species mentioned in the book. To keep my work safe, I also used Git for version control—very useful when a small LaTeX change suddenly breaks the entire compilation!  

Interestingly, I had written the book’s introduction quite early on, but I later realized it was much easier to find the right words once the main chapters were already in place.  

A huge amount of effort went into proofreading and editing. Rereading your own writing can be exhausting—especially when it’s an entire book. Luckily, my grandmother, who has always loved reading to her grandchildren, helped in a special way. I quickly translated some chapters with ChatGPT, and she read them aloud to me. This wasn’t about grammar, but about flow and
